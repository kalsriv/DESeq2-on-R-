# DESeq2-on-R-
These examples represent basic steps for RnaSeq data analysis using lR libraries such as DESeq2 and associated libraries. The target is to get the fold expression from count data. The example data has been downloded from the Recount wesite and is freely avilable. The gilad.eset data has been chosen in the example for its simplicity nd small size. Both .R and .Rmd files can be used for the analysis. Another repositiory titled "DESeq2-On-Python-Jupyter-Notebook" shows how to perform DESeq2 based analysis on jupyter notebook using hybrid of both R and Python.
